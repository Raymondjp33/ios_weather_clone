## Welcome!

This is a simple flutter project created for the problem that was posed of creating a simple stateless list widget. The list itself can be found in the list_widget.dart file and is used within the simple app to display a list of colors!

A launch.json file has been created so the debugger will work to run the project, otherwise good old `flutter run` should work just fine!
